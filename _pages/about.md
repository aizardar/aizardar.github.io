Welcome to my personal website! I am a Data Engineer with a background in computational materials science and have extensive experience in statistical modeling, computational simulations and machine learning. 

In my current role, I am responsible for implementing digital solutions to build the next generation of AI-enhanced R&D. I am part of the core team responsible for the implementation and further development of the electronic laboratory notebook, and developing and adopting statistics and machine learning algorithms to address challenging industrial problems. 

During my PhD at ETH Zurich, I specifically focused on performing quantum-mechanical simulations in conjunction with high-performance computing, data analytics, and machine learning to design and discover new magnetic materials. You can read my PhD thesis [here](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/551783) or you can listen to a 10 minute AI-generated podcast on my thesis [here](). 

Thank you for visiting my website and I look forward to sharing my knowledge and experience with you.
