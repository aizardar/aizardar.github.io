excerpt: 'In this paper, we use first-principles-based calculations to investigate the interplay between chemical order and the magnetic properties of 
L10 FeNi. In particular, we investigate how deviations from perfect chemical order affect the energy difference between the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic states as well as the important magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy. Our calculations demonstrate a strong effect of the magnetic order on the chemical order-disorder transition temperature and, conversely, a strong enhancement of the magnetic transition temperature by the chemical order. Most interestingly, our results indicate that the magnetic anisotropy does not decrease significantly as long as the deviations from perfect order are not too large. Moreover, we find that in certain cases a slight disorder can result in a higher anisotropy than for the fully ordered structure. We further analyze the correlation between the magnetocrystalline anisotropy and the orbital magnetic moment anisotropy, which allows to study the effect of the local chemical environment on both quantities, potentially enabling further optimization of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy with respect to chemical order and stoichiometric composition.'
