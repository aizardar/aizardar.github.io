During my PhD, I worked on rare-earth-free permanent magnets, where I employed Density functional theory, Monte Carlo simulations, and machine learning to investigate magnetic properties of L10 structured FeNi alloy - a promising permanent magnet first observed in iron meteorites. If you would like to read more on my research, you can find my PhD thesis ([here](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/551783)).
